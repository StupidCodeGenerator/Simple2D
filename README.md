# Simple2D
A simple and stupid 2D game framework with opengl.

Well, it will be a stupid work. I spent a lot of time to think if I should build a game engine for myself. I hate commercial game engine because I think they are too big. I just need a simple and stupid frame work and a couple of tools that can help me create my game rapidly.

So it must be as stupid as possible.

The step 1 plan is :

A frame work to avoid the opengl settings.
Some utility functions to load textures, load config files, draw basic shapes, Sprites .etc
Almost c, don't use c++ features if possible.
Less code if possible.

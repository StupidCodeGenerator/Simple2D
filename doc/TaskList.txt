1 Basics
	1.1 Basic shape render functions: DrawLine, DrawTriangle, DrawPolygon. (Done)
	1.2 Texture load and paint. (Done)
	1.3 Sprite. the texture size is 2^n * 2^n so we need to shape that. That's sprite
	1.4 SpriteSheet and loader. See Texturepacker. I'll use that for texture packing.

2 Advanced
	2.1 DialogMachine for my personal use. (Done)

Current work :
I need a sprite coordinate info file loader to read the sprite
coordinates.
The texture packer was not free so maybe I should write a python
script to do this.
